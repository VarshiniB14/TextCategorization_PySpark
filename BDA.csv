Even if it's something as simple as cheese garlic bread. You can feel that they use high quality ingredients. I was especially impressed by their Pesto sauce pasta. I have eaten delicious pesto sauce pasta in other restaurants too but those always used to be oily with lots of butter. The pasta this restaurant makes has almost no oil/butter and yet tastes delicious. Quantity is also good, one pasta can be shared by two people easily",5,Whitefield

2,Chulha Chauki Da Dhaba,Food is really tasty and food. A lot of crowd or customers always because of which Couldn't try their parata. Kullad Lassi is the best and place and ambience are also great.

2,Halli Mane,"Halli mane is one of the OGs of Malleswaram. Great taste, great pricing for most of the food. The mango milkshake was amazing but slightly pricey by halli mane standards. I wish they heated the Mangalore bhajji though.",4,Malleshwaram
2,Halli Mane,"This was my first experience with the karnataka festive meal. And I totally loved it. Place gives you the nostalgia feeling and their music is so soothing to the soul. Space is spacious and well decorated. I feel the authentic taste of karnataka here. Staff are polite, sweet and serve with a smile. If you are in karnataka then worth to visit this place. This place has my heart.",5,Malleshwaram
2,Halli Mane,Loved all the dishes especially the mango rasam. It was one of a kind and so tasty. All the dishes had some form of mango and tasted amazing! Definitely worth it.,5,Malleshwaram
2,Halli Mane,The ongoing mango mela was just devoid of mangoes. Not worth the full meal! As it was more of an artificial mango flavour dishes.,1,Malleshwaram
2,Moti Mahal Delux,"We visited Moti Mahal deluxe on weekend. Ambience is so good, staff behaviour is so friendly & food was so tasty & delicious. Service is good, served with in 10 minutes. Food was so tasty & delicious. Lot of options in both Veg & nonveg. Do visit with your family & friends.",5,HSR
2,Moti Mahal Delux,"The waiting time after you order the food is a bit too much.  Looks like they are understaffed.  Hence a 2 star for service. The staff were really pleasant and cheerful.Now to the food. Had ordered soup which was good, tandoori chicken tikka starter was okay okay.  The let down was the so called iconic butter chicken gravy. It was tasting more like tomato soup with chicken pieces put into it.  Have had better food than that. Did not  expect this out of an iconic chain",2,HSR
2,Moti Mahal Delux,"The food quality and taste is good, however the cost is little on the higher side. For such a cost i would go to a little up market place.",4,HSR

2,Moti Mahal Delux,"Had chicken lababdar, taste was awesome, the ambiance is very good, Captain Tony serve me really well,Had a good time!!!!",5,HSR
2,Paakashala,Great taste. Filter coffee is a must. Loved their Onion Rava Dosa and Rava Idli.,5,MG Road
2,Paakashala,Food taste is good and vast varieties of food available. Service is so so and can be improved. Huge waiting time once you order. We tried north India food that was good and tasty. Price wise it is not so costly it is ok ok. Located on the main road and easy to locate from mg road.,4,MG Road
2,Paakashala,"Calm and cool restaurant on the busiest place. Food was exceptional with good service. Not much crowd for the breakfast. Slightly costlier than darshinis. Well maintained, neat, clean and hygienic. Interiors were thoughtfully inspired design. No specific parking allotted and have to use public parking space. Recommended.",4,MG Road
2,Paakashala,"Very good food, good ambiance, excellent location and the staff are cordial and quick. The filter coffee was excellent! Have passed by the place several times but checking it out for the first time. I ordered my favorite samosa masala and it was excellent!",5,MG Road

2,Karnatic,"It's a delicious authentic south Indian food place. Would recommend the Non-veg/ Veg platter. The mutton chops and the fresh fish curry were scrumptious. Finally don't miss out on coconut moose/pudding, MUST TRY!!",5,Church St
2,Karnatic,"The place may feel a bit closed off and dark to some people but to others it just adds to the charm. The service was on point. The servers were sweet. And the food was amazing. We jad a few things there and their Fish Kebab was absolutely delicious(they do season them with chilli so if you think u wont be able to handle the spice, you can simply shake off the chilli flakes or just ask them not to put much chilli), for me though it was perfect level of spice. We finished the meal off with an obattu and boy it was amazing. Definitely a place worth visiting. As this place does not dabble on any cuisine apart from the ones from the southern states, meaning you can expect to get pretty good representation of different south indian cuisines with high authenticity, or atleast as high as you can find without going to the states themselves.",4,Church St
3,California Burrito Mexican Grill ,"It was my first vist to this restaurant chain, I loved it a lot, they offer two bowls option rice based or salad based. Make it as you like it, by adding toppings of your choice.",5,Marathahalli

3,TEX MEX RESTAURANT,"Excellent food - try the  beef steak too good, burgers ....",5,Kalyan Nagar
3,TEX MEX RESTAURANT,"Amazing food.. but way over priced. The ambience is great , they have a roof top as well. Ample space to sit and eat. The service is good as well. I am very sure, you are only supposed to pay the MRP price on a water bottle. But they charge you double of it, it's not about paying 20 rupees extra, but rules are there for a reason.",5,Kalyan Nagar
3,TEX MEX RESTAURANT,Great food and good ambiance. No compromise on the taste of the good. Tad bit expensive,4,Kalyan Nagar
3,TEX MEX RESTAURANT,Decent food but the pizzeria was closed had to make do with what was available. Do feel they need more diverse menu,4,Kalyan Nagar
3,Chinita Real Mexican Food,Amazing and delicious food. Budhiman has assisted us very professionally and the suggested menu was delicious. The ambiance is nice. You can get space to park below. Very neat and clean. And service was also really quick. Do you visit the place if you want to Mexican food anytime in Bangalore.,5,Indira Nagar
3,Chinita Real Mexican Food,"This place has to be in everyone’s list. The large open space, benches, big glass side windows are adding an extra charm. Coming to food, with very first bite you will be roaming around the Mexican lanes. Its so soo authentic and yummy. I will be honest, the drinks were not that impressive. It was rather average. Tacos churros burritos are awesome to try.",5,Indira Nagar
3,Chinita Real Mexican Food,"Such a cute place. Indian version of a cantina and the food is pretty close to authentic. They got the guacamole pretty spot on and the chips were real tortilla chips, not like what I usually get in Indian restaurants. I had the chicken tacos which were really tasty. The chicken was cooked well and very flavorful. All the toppings were great and it came with pickled jalapenos, which was great. I also had the Mexican rice which wasn't bad. I wanted to try the frijoles but they weren't refried, just whole beans so I passed on that. They don't have a liquor license so the margaritas are virgin, but still pretty tasty. Not a bad price for appetizers, drinks and meals.",5,Indira Nagar
3,Chinita Real Mexican Food,"Good Mexican food. They have vegan options in their menu and we loved Soyarizo Nachos. Our server Viky was great, he listened to our questions and gave great food suggestions. Overall great food and very good ambiance.",4,Indira Nagar
3,Chinita Real Mexican Food,"Great food, decent ambiance with a good view. Their nachos, tacos, hot chocolate and passion fruit iced tea are hands down the best. Do try their salsa too, it's something different. …",5,Indira Nagar
3,Chinita Real Mexican Food,Had a lot of fun at this place. The food is great! Do try the nachos. The music was good. Ambiance was good. You can visit this place with your friends or family and have long and relaxed conversations. I'd encourage you to visit this place because its going to be worth it!,5,Indira Nagar
3,Chinita Real Mexican Food,"This place has got to be one of the best places to eat in Bangalore. Since it is perched on top on the 1st floor and parking was tricky we almost decided not to go but I’m so glad we did. The ambience is simple, the place is well lit and breezy, decor is easy on the eyes. The food was outstanding! The flavours were amazing and portions very good. The prices are reasonable too. I guess we ordered an extra dish to share and in the end were super stuffed. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience and will definitely visit again to try out the dishes we missed. Will recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy some great Mexican food!",5,Indira Nagar
3,Chinita Real Mexican Food,Authentic Mexican food. Food is damn tasty. And hygiene is well maintained.  Well behaved staff.No parking space.,4,Indira Nagar
3,Taco Bell,"As expected the place was quite chic, music was cool, service was quick and personalised, unfortunately this time in this taco Bell unit food quality was not up to the mark french fries soggy and ice tea was sad. Roll and taco lived up to the expectations. Staff courtesy was top notch. Cleanliness is really good as compared to other fastfood joints in the vicinity so is the staff courtesy.This time only the (staff courtesy) and signature dish proved itself to be an underrated fast food joint in the market.",3,HSR 
3,Taco Bell,"After a long time again went to Taco bell for dinner. Taste is good & the people who wanted to try different tastes, will suit. Their fries are tasty & crispy.",4,HSR 
3,Taco Bell,"Now, Taco Bell might not be ""authentic Mexican"" but it sure as hell is tasty AF. It's fresh and just like America, you also get unlimited refills here so what's more to say.Will definitely hit up a Taco Bell when I come back to Bengaluru.Parking: Ample space available for those coming in their vehicles.",5,HSR 
3,Taco Bell,"Great place, with tasty food, the portions were worth it, it's kid friendly. The ambience was awesome too. There are a lot of vegetarian options too",5,HSR 
3,Taco Bell,"This is a newly opened Taco bell. The whole place was nice, clean and cheerful. The service was excellent and the food was good.
Vegetarian options: Many veggie options",5,HSR 
3,Taco Bell,For a new start they are doing a great job by making sure about customer satisfaction. These guys are giving their best. One thing I felt was they were short handed. But everything is great.,5,HSR 
3,Taco Bell,"The vibe of this place is amazing, I really like their interiors. Service is too good.Fries are really good! Actually the whole menu is fabulous.",5,HSR 
3,Taco Bell,The best taco bell I've ordered from. They always make sure to include the hot sauses which is not the case with other outlets.,5,HSR 
3,Sanchez,The Mexican food at Sanchez at UB City is just awesome. Everything we ordered was not only tasted good but also looked fresh. The presentation is awesome. Chicken Nachos and a chicken Burrito is what I would recommended. The service is very Co-ordinal and open air ambience was pleasant. A must try Mexican food in bangalore.,5, Ashok Nagar
3,Sanchez,"Was here for lunch, waited at the reception desk to be seated, no one was there at staff around the bar counter were least bothered as they were busy chatting away. Finally we went ahead and occupied the table, there was hardly any rush as the restaurant was quite empty. Even the staff were less. Finally found some one and placed our orders, service as expected was not good at all. What really made up for everything was that the food was too good, the food actually saved the day. Chilli Carne Chicken Tacos, chicken burritos, corn jalapeño potato skins, beans quesadillas, everything was perfect.",3, Ashok Nagar
3,Sanchez,"The food is lovely n tasty and money's worth. However, in the bar section, the bar man was not professional and cheated on the drinks, especially in the making of  cocktails.",3, Ashok Nagar
3,Sanchez,Nice place for a relaxed evening. Great starters nice ambience. Main course and service is also great. If you want to enjoy this place most catch hold of the guy named Rajesh. He is an effiecient person and make good food suggestions.,3, Ashok Nagar
3,Sanchez,"Chakra was super kind and helpful. Very sweet and warm staff of Sanchez. We loved the food, ambience and service. We also appreciate Rajesh's patience in explaining every dish and taking extra care of us. We will visit again.",5, Ashok Nagar
3,Sanchez Taqueria & Cantina Indiranagar,"The place is really colourfull and vibrant. The food and service outstanding and felt genuinely Mexican. Remember that they have now a common kitchen so the menu of Sriracha is on offer too. We stuck to the mexican and from nachos to fajita, hard shelled tacos, potato skins with chicken were really delicious. Parking can be a bit of an issue so park on one of the parallel streets.",5,Indranagar

3,Sanchez Taqueria & Cantina Indiranagar,"It's a smaller place as far as restaurants go but not too crowded, would definitely recommend going on a weekday night. Food was light and tasty, the Chipotle chicken tacos (soft) are pretty good. The tres leches dessert is good too. There's not much atmosphere. This is Indiranagar so don't expect any parking, pick a street. Cost around 1200 per person, pretty expensive given the quantity of food.",5,Indranagar
3,Sanchez Taqueria & Cantina Indiranagar,"Best ever Mexican food in town!!! The place is so beautiful and the food leaves no stone unturned . The place has a brilliant vibe to it . The menu is all Mexican and serves a wide range of dishes . The guacamole here is a must try. I personally recommend the same !!

Also, the prices are on a bit of expensive side.But it’s a must try if you love mexican food. We tried Chicken House Taco Salad, Sanchez Fiesta Nachos, Habanero boness chicken and Churros and didn’t regret anything.",4,Indranagar
3,Sanchez Taqueria & Cantina Indiranagar,"One of the best places in town to have Mexican food. Rare place that serves Mexican food better than Chinita. Loved the guacamole here so smooth, brilliant texture & taste. The Fajita was one of the best you get in Bangalore. The ambience is pretty casual. You have bother outdoor & indoor seating with both high & low chairs. The wait time for food can be a tad long but the wait is completely worth it!",4,Indranagar
3,Chimichurri Mexican Restaurant,Very good restaurant in this area.. Food was amazing and above expectations. I wanted to try so I took a 30km ride just to try the Mexican food and I was surprised to see the atmosphere and the quality of food.. off course it’s 5,5,Sanjayanagara

4,Daily Sushi ,The place is quite authentic. Staffs are good. Bit small space they have. Service is okeish a bit slow the space being small. Being our first time we didn’t like sushi much. Ramen was good though.,3,Whitefield
4,Daily Sushi ,"Wanted to try ramen, so went to this place. They said ramen would be bland while a similar korean dish called romyun would be spicier. Tried the prawn romyun. 3 fried prawns and some fried veggie was added. Lot of mushrooms and egg was there. The romyun was too oily and I felt bloated after eating. The quantity would be enough for 2. Was disappointed.",2,Whitefield

4,Dam's Kitchen,"One of the best places for Korean cuisine in Bangalore. It is a quaint little place and they serve Soju and beer as well. We had Japchae, Jajangmyeon, Kimbap and Korean Fried Chicken . I really enjoyed Japchae as it was sweet and sour and very well seasoned. Jajang was also flavourful but could have been better. The chicken was very crispy and the pieces were huge but would try the one with sauce next time to compare. I was impressed with the quality of side dishes (Banchan) as it was fresh compared to other places I have eaten Korean places in the city. We even got complimentary watermelon slices in dessert from the owners. It is priced a little lower than other places with serve this cuisine so will defiantly go back for more.",4,Kalyan Nagar
4,Dam's Kitchen,"Nice Korean restaurant with decent menu.The seatings are available on the second floor with twisted interior which provide a little privacy. Didn’t really enjoy the meat, was just okay~okayy",4,Kalyan Nagar
4,Dam's Kitchen,Best place to have authentic Korean food. I have to tried many places in Bangalore but this has been great and worth the price.,5,Kalyan Nagar
4,Dam's Kitchen,"If you are a K-Pop/K-Drama fan or Korean language student, you would find this place an awesome one to tryout authentic Korean dishes along with Soju, you could also speak to the owner in Korean! If you are a vegetarian please do mention it specifically.",5,Kalyan Nagar
4,Dam's Kitchen,"The food was perfect, good service quite place ,it was awesome great experience..much love to Korean people ",5,Kalyan Nagar
4,Dam's Kitchen,"The owner is very sweet, greets you politely as you enter. This is a simple no frills restaurant. A straightforward bill, no service charge added to bill. Food is okay, neither bad nor too good. The Sogalbijjim was flavourful, the bibimbab didn’t look appealing like the usual bowl of colour with egg, rice, veg/pickles instead it was just covered in strands of seaweed and lettuce, also lacked in taste. The gogi mandu/dumpling was very bland, something wasn’t just right",4,Kalyan Nagar
4,Dam's Kitchen,We had dinner from this place. The ambience is okay which was not a concern for us. Coming to the food part we ordered ramen for our daughter since she likes it . Flavour wise it was good but price is 500 for small bowl ramen. I don't understand why so expensive for such a small bow or else they need to increase the portions. We ordered egg washed prawns veg mixed fritter dish which was super bland and there wasn't even prawns flavour  and then we had beef which was really good and flavorful. But again 800 for that dish is something i cannot understand. Overall it was not a good experience,2,Kalyan Nagar
